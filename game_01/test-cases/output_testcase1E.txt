Welcome to Blizzard Valley!
You and six children were hiking in the mountains when an
unexpected blizzard blew up.  Find the children and get them all
back to the hiking lodge on the other side of the river.

You are at a bend on a steep mountain trail running along the
top of a cliff.  The trail leads north and west from here. Icy
cliffs to the east and south lead to a rushing river below.

You are at a T-junction on a north/south mountain trail.  From  
here, a narrower trail leads east.  There is impenetrable forest
to the west and the trial opens up to the north.

Next? e
You are near some picnic tables close to the top of a cliff.  A
narrow trail leads west and there is a rushing river at the    
bottom of icy cliffs to the east and south.  You can see a     
steep, icy path leading down the cliff to a frozen stretch of  
the river to the east.

You are on a massive snowdrift, packed hard by the driving wind.
There is an open area to the west and broken rocks to the east.
To the north and south are impenetrable forest.

Next? s
There is no way to go in that direction
Next? e
You are picking your way among large, irregular rocks.  Gusts of
wind blow the falling snow this way and that.  Much of it ends
up blowing to the west, where it piles onto a massive snowdrift.
There are also gaps between the rocks leading east and south.

Next? s
You are on the north bank of a rushing river, at the edge of an
area filled with large rocks.  There is a rusty iron footbridge
to the south and an impenetrable forest to the east.  Gaps lead
between the rocks to the north and east.

Next? s
You are on a rusty iron bridge over a rushing river.  Through
the blowing snow, you can see large rocks on the north bank and
a forest on the south one.  You could also climb down onto the
ice bordering the river to the east and west.

Next? s
You are on the bank of a rushing river, just inside the edge of
a forest.  There is a rusty iron bridge to the north and a path
leads into the trees to the east.  To the west, the river has
frozen over, forming an ice bridge.

Next? e
You are at a T-junction on a forest path.  The main path leads
south and west, and a fainter trail leads down to a rushing
river to the north.

There is no way to go in that direction
Next? s
You are on a north/south path through the forest.  Stately
lodgepole pines stand like pillars around you.  Little snow
falls here, and the wind is calmer.
